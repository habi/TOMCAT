Generally mounting and synchronizing disks should work if you follow the steps below:

    Open the Computer window (double click on the top left icon on the desktop)
    Turn on your disk (should work for eSATA and USB3.0)
    Connect the disk to one of the 5 eSATA or one of the 3 USB ports
    After a few seconds, the system should recognize the external disk and the disk will show up in the "Computer" window you opened before. USB disks should be auto-mounted while eSATA disks will be mounted if you doubleclick on them in said window.
    After the disk has been mounted (USB automagically, eSATA after doubleclick), the icon of the disk should show up on the desktop.
    Open the terminal (Top left icon > System Tools > Terminal)
    Type in df in the terminal, which lists all mounted disks. The external disk will usually be called something like /media/SOME_NAME
    Start the synchronization by issuing rsyncdir -t 60000 [source-dir] [target-dir] in the terminal. For instance: rsyncdir -t 60000 ~/Data10/disk1 /media/disk1/
    There is also the possibility to copy only selected directories (e.g. rec_8bit) and exclude others. To do so write a file (e.g. exclude.txt) with the list of directories to exclude in your home directory and run the command: 

cd;rsyncdir -t 60000 --exclude-from=exclude.txt ~/Data10/disk1 /media/disk1/;cd -
