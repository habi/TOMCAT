# Handy snippets
Some of the snippets (for convience) will be left on gist with hard links in the [README](README.md).
The names of the files should be descriptive, otherwise just ask!
You'll find the first author of each script in its header...

## Touch, Reconstruct, Compress, and Send via Email
- [These scripts](https://gist.github.com/kmader/451d84937014b75368db) can be used to
  - `touch` (prevent deletion)
  - perform reconstruction (using standard parameters)
  - compress (into a single tar archive with up to 10x size improvements), and
  - send the files using the [CIFEX system of the ETHZ](https://cifex.ethz.ch/) (up to 300GB/day, requires ETH login for sender (but not reciever)).
