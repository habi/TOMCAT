# Scanning stuff
These are scanning macros for use with [SPEC](http://www.certif.com/spec.html) and accompanying bash and Python scripts for running more complicated scans.

- [`fasttomo_edge_Aerotech.mac`] is the standard tomography macro using end-station 1, the edge camera and the aerotech stage.
- [`multiscan.py`] is an example script for automating starting scans and changing sample names using epics channel interfaces.
- [`stacked_scan.py`] can be used to perform multiple overlapping scans along the rotation axis of the sample.
