# Nicely written code is good code.

The Python files in the TOMCAT scripts repository should conform to coding standards.
This makes the code easier to read and understand and much easier to maintain.

The code should at least conform to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the Style Guide for Python Code.
We should use [PyLint](http://www.pylint.org/) for checking our code and trying to keep our coding standards up.

This subfolder contains some helpers to do so.
